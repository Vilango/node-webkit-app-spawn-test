node-webkit-app-spawn-test
==========================

This is a sample app for testing out how to spawn an node-webkit app from an other node-webkit app and have some kind of communication between them.

Running under OSX:

```
node runTest.js
```

This will get you node-webkit and then creates two apps.
It starts the first one. The second one is then opened by the first on.
